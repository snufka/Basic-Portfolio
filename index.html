    <p style="display:flex;left:">
            <img src="C:\Users\Marina\Documents\GitHub\Basic-Portfolio\assets\images\marina-avatar.jpg"> My name is Marina and I'm a proud owner of a dog named Joey and a cat named Stevie. Original fro Tel Aviv, I have been living in Belin for the past 3 years with my husband. A year and a half ago your daughter Lyri joined us.         
      My favorite things in life are my family and friends, coffee and reading. I usually read 3-4 books at the same time, I use books as escapism so my favorite genres are Yong adults books and fantasy. 
        I'm excited to start my journey into becoming web developer.
